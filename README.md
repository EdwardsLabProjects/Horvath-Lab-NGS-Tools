## [RNA2DNAlign](RNA2DNAlign)
RNA2DNAlign evaluates evidence for asymmetric allele distribution in next-gen sequencing reads of DNA and RNA samples from the same individual
## [SNPlice](SNPlice)
SNPlice finds and evaluates the co-occurrence of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) and altered splicing in next-gen mRNA sequence reads.
## [readCounts](readCounts)
readCounts evaluates and counts the reads for asymmetric allele distribution in
next-gen sequencing across multiple samples from the same individual.
