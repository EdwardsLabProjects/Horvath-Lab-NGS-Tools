## [SCReadCounts](SCReadCounts#readme) 
SCReadCounts is a computational tool for a cell-level assessment of the read counts bearing a particular nucleotide at genomic positions of interest from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. 
## [ReadCounts](ReadCounts#readme) 
ReadCounts tabulates the number of reads providing evidence for variant and reference nucleotides at specific genomic loci and applies statistical tests to recognize allelic read-counts consistent with homozygous and heterozygous loci.
## [RNA2DNAlign](RNA2DNAlign#readme)
RNA2DNAlign evaluates evidence for asymmetric allele distribution in next-gen sequencing reads of DNA and RNA samples from the same individual.
## [SNPlice](SNPlice#readme)
SNPlice finds and evaluates the co-occurrence of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) and altered splicing in next-gen mRNA sequence reads.
