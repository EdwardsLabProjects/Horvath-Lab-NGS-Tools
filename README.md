## [RNA2DNAlign](RNA2DNAlign)
RNA2DNAlign evaluates evidence for asymmetric allele distribution in next-gen sequencing reads of DNA and RNA samples from the same individual
## [SNPlice](SNPlice)
SNPlice finds and evaluates the co-occurrence of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) and altered splicing in next-gen mRNA sequence reads.
## [SCReadCounts](SCReadCounts) 
scReadCounts extracts the VAF matrix for single-cell sequencing workflows from reads labelled with cell-barcodes. 
## [ReadCounts](ReadCounts) 
readCounts tabulates variant and reference nucleotides at genomic positions of interest and applies statistical tests to recognize allelic read-counts consistent with homozygous and heterozygous loci.
