SNPlice is a software tool to find and evaluate the co-occurrence of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) and altered splicing in next-gen mRNA sequence reads. SNPlice requires, as input: genome aligned reads, exon-intron-exon junctions, and SNPs. exon-intron-exon junctions and SNPs may be derived from the reads directly, using, for example, TopHat2 and samtools, or they may be derived from independent sources.
