# Introduction# Workflow![Pipeline](https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS/tree/master/scReQTL/docs/Pipeline_v2.png?raw=True)The picture above (a) illustrates our workflow in a concise manner.This tutorial goes through following steps:1. Producing VAFs through SCReadCounts [download_SCReadCounts](https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS/tree/master/SCReadCounts).2. Gene-cell matrices pre-processing, clustering and assigning cell-types [Seurat_and_SingleR](https://github.com/hliu5259/scReQTL).3. scReQTL [scripts](https://github.com/HorvathLab/ReQTL/):	a. Harmonize matrices (harmonize_matrices.R) 	b. Run matrix scReQTL (run_matrix_ReQTL.R)	c. Annotate cis-trans scReQTLs (annotate_cis_trans.R)
