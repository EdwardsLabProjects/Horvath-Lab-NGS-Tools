# Introduction# Workflow![Pipeline](https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS/blob/master/scReQTL/docs/pipeline.png?raw=true)The picture above (a) illustrates our workflow in a concise manner.This tutorial goes through following steps:1. Producing VAFs through [SCReadCounts](https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS/tree/master/SCReadCounts).2. Gene-cell matrices pre-processing, clustering and assigning cell-types [using Seurat_and_SingleR](https://github.com/hliu5259/scReQTL).3. scReQTL:    1. Harmonize matrices [harmonize_matrices.R](https://github.com/HorvathLab/ReQTL/)    2. Run matrix scReQTL [run_matrix_ReQTL.R](https://github.com/HorvathLab/ReQTL/)    3. Annotate cis-trans scReQTLs [annotate_cis_trans.R](https://github.com/HorvathLab/ReQTL/)    4. Plot the scReQTLs [Plot_scReQTLs_inbulk.R](https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS/tree/master/scReQTL/docs/Plot_scReQTLs_inbulk.R)
